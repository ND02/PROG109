 <p>
   1) What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?<br>
   Before taking this class, I had no knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript. I took this class because it is an important skill to learn, since I want to enroll in
   the Interactive Media Design major.<br>
   
   2) Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?<br>
   I build my portfolio from scratch. I had an idea in my head about how I wanted it to look. I sketched out the pages, and then coded them form scratch. This experience 
   was challenging for me.<br>
   
   3) What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)<br>
   The most challenging oart was the contact form. I was having a really hard time with the validation.<br>
   
   4) How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?<br>
   This class has made me realize that I do not like the coding side of design, only the design portion. But, I am glad that I learned this skill,
   maybe it will come to use in the future.<br>
   
   5)What would you recommend to future students taking this class?<br>
   I would say make sure you are ready to memorize a lot of tags and rules. This makes creating pages a lot faster. I would also say communicate with your professor. This course has been really
   difficult for me and the professor has helped me every step of the way.
